# TODO List
- [o] Refactor fin_start()
  - [X] Refactor load_companies()
  - [ ] 

## Additional Features

### UI/UX
- [ ] Allow users to delete wrong entries when entering in companies to load
- [ ] When reading the tickers, I feel that the more freedom the better
  - [ ] Because when you are gathering company information, sometimes you want to load a company that is in the same country as another, and then you may want to also load a company from the same country but different industry. So you might have it grouped that way.

### Comparables Analysis
- [ ] Get the share price and add it to company statistics

### DCF Analysis
- [ ] 

## General
- [ ] Switch the API from the Yahoo finance API to the financial modeling prep API
- [ ] Look into using Finviz finance
- [X] Fix the bug that read the wrong file name

## Notes
- [ ] Think about memory management and efficiency in the future. Is my program too memory intensive? Do I need to be recursing so much?
- [ ] I think that when I begin using a TUI framework, things will be better
